See the R Zero Documentation notebook for the purpose statement, goals, and methodology.  As the analysis progresses, insights and findings will also be documented there.

All notebooks prefixed with "Exploration" are meant to explore datasets, look for correlations, etc. No findings will be documented in these notebooks.

The SIR Model - Fit to Covid Data notebook is the primary notebook that we are working in at this time.

Contributors: Feel free to create as many exploration notebooks as you desire. If you wish to work from the SIR Model notebook, make sure you always pull down the latest changes before you commit. Always add content, never replace content. As you progress, make sure you are documenting your findings in the documentation notebook as well.
